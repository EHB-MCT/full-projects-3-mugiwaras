        <p> When the tyrannosaurs ruled the mainland, giant flesh-eating lizards
        roamed the oceans: the mosasaurs. Interestingly, many have never heard
        of these imposing creatures. That will change after a visit to our
        Mosasaur Hall: it showcases a beautiful selection from our mosasaur
        collection, which belongs to the world's top. They are displayed in a
        clear and atmospheric hall, next to the iguanodon display in the mine.</p>
        <p class="lastp"> One of the fossils of Belgian origin is the beautiful Hainosaurus
        bernardi, a mosasaur measuring 12.5 meters long! Admire the
        contemporaries of these powerful marine reptiles, compare their anatomy
        to that of reptiles and other living animals, discover how they swam and
        captured their prey...</p>
