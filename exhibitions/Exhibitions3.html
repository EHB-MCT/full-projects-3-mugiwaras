        No, a city is not just made up of cobblestones, walls, and concrete!
        There are many more animals and plants to be found than you might
        think. Did you think that there might be a worm in the corner of your
        garden? Have you ever followed a blue-winged grasshopper along a
        railway embankment? Or experienced a day in the life of a hedgehog?
        he city may sometimes seem gloomy and gray, but it is full of
        surprises!</p>
      <p class="lastp"> TThrough BiodiverCITY, you learn about urban biodiversity
        through specimens, photos, films, and interactive applications. Thanks
        to computer simulations, you also play an active role and can take
        various measures to efficiently protect biodiversity in the city.
