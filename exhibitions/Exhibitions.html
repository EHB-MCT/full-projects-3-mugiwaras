            The Gallery of Dinosaurs is the largest hall in Europe dedicated
            entirely to dinosaurs. Dozens of specimens on an area of over 3000
            square meters tell the story of their discovery, life and
            evolution...
          </p>

          <p>
            The dinosaurs appeared at the end of the Triassic period, almost 230
            million years ago. During the Jurassic period, they became more
            numerous and diverse and inhabited all continents. At the end of the
            Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago, they became extinct. But
            are they really gone? That's not so certain...
          </p>

          <p>
            In the gallery, you will see how Olorotitan dies, learn how fossils
            are formed and challenge a virtual Pachycephalosaurus. Listen to the
            scream of Parasaurolophus, learn about cladistics, give each
            hadrosaur its own crest... Visit the Gallery of Dinosaurs with our
            Saura App or the Be My Guide podcasts...or both!
