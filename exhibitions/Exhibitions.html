        The Gallery of Dinosaurs is the largest hall in Europe dedicated
        entirely to dinosaurs. Dozens of specimens on an area of over 3000
        square meters tell the story of their discovery, life and
        evolution...
      </p>

      <p>
        The dinosaurs appeared at the end of the Triassic period, almost 230
        million years ago. During the Jurassic period, they became more
        numerous and diverse and inhabited all continents. At the end of the
        Cretaceous period, 65 million years ago, they became extinct. But
        are they really gone? That's not so certain...
      </p>

      <p>
        In the gallery, you will see how Olorotitan dies, learn how fossils
        are formed and challenge a virtual Pachycephalosaurus. Listen to the
        scream of Parasaurolophus, learn about cladistics, give each
        hadrosaur its own crest... Visit the Gallery of Dinosaurs with our
        Saura App or the Be My Guide podcasts...or both!
